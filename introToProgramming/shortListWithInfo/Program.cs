        C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, C#. 
        C is the basic language, because: Java, PHP, JavaScript, C# etc. 
        borrowed directly or indirectly from C. C++ was originally named C with Classes plus 
        enhancements to the C language, adding object oriented features like classes. PHP is 
        designed for web development. JavaScript is implemented as part of web browsers. 
        Java derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
        The C# language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. 
        Some C# features:
        	classes, structs, primitive types, arrays, boxing, interfaces, inheritance (abstract, virtual, new, sealed),
            properties, nullables
        	exceptions
        	generics
        	multi threading, locks
        	reflection
        	delegates, events, anonymous delegates
        	iterators
        	lambda expressions
        	extension methods
        	linq
